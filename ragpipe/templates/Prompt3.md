What impacts has this research delivered to date? (Max 600 words)

Impact is defined as the flow-on effects of research outputs on policy and clinical practice, health and quality of life, the economy, and society. Impacts may include but not be limited to the effects on the health system, determinants of health, decision-making, population health, and the economy. Provide clear and specific evidence to support claims about the impact of research. This may include data on changes in policy or practice, testimonials from stakeholders who have benefited from the research, or any other relevant indicators. Explain the significance of the impact the research has had, both in terms of its practical implications and its contribution to broader academic or societal goals.

Impacts should be under the RIAF Indicator Categories and can include:
- **Population health**: morbidity indicators that quantify the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of disease, illness, and injuries within a population (e.g. Prevalence, Incidence); Mortality indicators (e.g. Potential years life lost due to premature death, Number and rate of death due to various causes, Age-specific death rate); Quality of life indicators (e.g. Quality-adjusted life years, Patient reported outcome measures, Surveys on health-related quality of life), wellbeing indicators (e.g. Proportion of adults with psychological distress, Self-assessed health status).

- **Economic**: commercial indicators  that measure the impact from the translation of health research into new products or services (e.g. Licensing returns, Valuation of spin-out companies); health benefit indicators that measure the economic benefit of improved health and quality of life (e.g. improvement in health measured through PROMs gained and divided by the cost of achieving that health gain, the estimated cost saving from the new technology or process developed compared to the current model of care.)

- **Reputation and brand**: Perceived competence indicators that measure the level of confidence and trust that an organisation is perceived to have in their ability to effective and competently conduct research and research translation. (e.g. Performance evaluations by reputable organisations: National/global rankings that are based on transparent and objective analysis of a research organisation’s performance.); Perceived goodwill indicators that measure the level of positive sentiment or favourable attitudes that are attributed to an organisation because of the reputation and brand image created by its excellence in research and research translation (e.g. Survey of key research partners and funders on the organisation’s research quality and impact).
