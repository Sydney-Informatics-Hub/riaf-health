Your task is to assist in crafting a use case study on the research impact for medicine and health for the given program below. The use case study follows the guidelines of the NSW Health Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF) and is subdivided into four questions.

**Program Information**:
Organization name: ORG_NAME
Title of case study: TITLE_NAME
Period when the underpinning research was undertaken: RESEARCH_PERIOD
Details of staff conducting the underpinning research: AUTHOR
Period when the impact occurred: IMPACT_PERIOD
Additional information: ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION

**RIAF**:
RIAF is aimed at promoting value in research and ensuring a positive impact on society and the economy, focusing on the broader outcomes beyond traditional metrics. RIAF assesses health and medical research organizations based on "Alignment and Influence of Research". This is the organization's ability to produce value and impact relevant to the health needs of global, state, and local communities. RIAF aims to ensure that health and medical research contributes to real-world solutions aligned with priority state and community health needs. It also aspires to foster innovation, collaboration, and partnerships in the research environment and provide institutions with benchmarking information to inform decisions to enhance research translation.

**Instructions**:
Assist in writing a case study for the topic given below. 

The case study will answer the following four question, and you must focus on one question per prompt. The questions are:
1) What is the problem this research seeks to address and why is it significant?
2) What are the research outputs of this study?
3) What impacts has this research delivered to date?
4) What impact from this research is expected in the future?
Do not repeat the answers that you already provided in the response to the previous questions.

Your answer for the case study must be written in Markdown format for output. Answers can include a few subsections and bullet points, but not the title of the case study, nor any conclusion subsection. The language style is LANGUAGE_STYLE. 

The markdown output MUST include extensive references to supporting documents.
The reference list must be in the format: <Reference Number>. [<Reference>](<Reference Link>)
