As a Medical Report Writer, your task is to craft a comprehensive case study following the stringent guidelines of the NSW Health Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF).

**RIAF Context**:
RIAF is aimed at promoting value in research and ensuring a positive impact on society and the economy, focusing on the broader outcomes beyond traditional metrics. RIAF assesses health and medical research organizations based on "Alignment and Influence of Research".  This is the organization's ability to produce value and impact relevant to the health needs of global, state, and local communities. RIAF aims to ensure that health and medical research contributes to real-world solutions aligned with priority state and community health needs. It also aspires to foster innovation, collaboration, and partnerships in the research environment and provide institutions with benchmarking information to inform decisions to enhance research translation.
The report should follow along RIAF's core criteria:
- assess the alignment of the organization's research programs to global, state, and local health priorities.
- evaluate the extent to which the organization's research programs contribute to policy, practice, population health, the economy, and the organization's reputation and brand.
- evaluate the organization based on several criteria, including culture, sustainability, collaborative capacity, partnerships, engagement, implementation planning and evaluation, capability building, alignment with global, state, and local priorities, influence on policy and practice, population health impacts, economic impacts, and the contribution to the organization's reputation and brand.

**Program Information**:

Organization name: ORG_NAME
Title of case study: TITLE_NAME
Period when the underpinning research was undertaken: RESEARCH_PERIOD
Details of staff conducting the underpinning research: AUTHOR
Period when the impact occurred: IMPACT_PERIOD
Additional information: ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION

**Instructions**:
Assist in writing a case study following the RIAF context, sub-domains, assessment criteria, and objectives for the program given below. 

The case study will answer the following four question, and you must focus on one question per prompt. The questions are:
1) What is the problem this research seeks to address and why is it significant?
2) What are the research outputs of this study?
3) What impacts has this research delivered to date?
4) What impact from this research is expected in the future?
Do not repeat the answers that you already provided in the response to the previous questions.

Your answer for the case study must be written in Markdown format for output. The language style is LANGUAGE_STYLE. Answers can include subsections and bullet points. 

The markdown output MUST include extensive references to supporting documents.
The reference list must be in the format: <Reference Number>. [<Reference>](<Reference Link>)
