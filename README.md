## Introduction

This AI software generates research impact assessment studies for health and medical research, in accordance with the Research Impact Assessment Framework (RIAF). The RIAF evaluates the research environment and the alignment and influence of research, with the goal of providing funders a holistic analysis of NSWâ€™s health and medical research ecosystem for making informed investment decisions.

To improve the scalability of this framework, an AI powered software has been developed that allows researchers and funding organisations to generate assessment reports about the research impact for a given research group and topic. Research impact is evaluated along distinct criteria such as overall problem addressed, research impact-to-date, and potential future applications. The current design of the case study template includes four assessment criteria and provides researchers the freedom to use a set of indicators that are relevant to their research program (e.g. research/impact period).

The AI generator combines Large Language Models (LLM) with factual knowledge retrievers such as scholar publications and web content. For a complete overview of the system please see the [Technical Documentation](documentation/Technical_Documentation_ResearchPulse.pdf).

3. Data reader: Reading data from these sources and text conversion
4. Data index generator: Index data, extract metadata and store content as vector database (see 'ragpipe/indexengine/process.py')
5. General context generation: problem and context analyser, find missing information online, add to context memory.
6. RAG engine (see 'ragpipe/rag.py'): Retrieving context based on:
    - query
    - instructions
    - data content and vector embeddings
    - metadata
    - context memory
7. LLM multi-stage prompt engine: Iterate over questions (see Prompt files in folder 'ragpipe/templates').
8. Multi-stage review. Check each answer and suggest improvements (for review criteria see Review files in folder 'ragpipe/templates').
9. Reference engine: retrieve corresponding publication references and convert to readable format  (see 'ragpipe/utils/pubprocess.py').
10. Report generator: produce, format, and save the final use case study report (see 'ragpipe/rag.py'), convert report into different formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX).
